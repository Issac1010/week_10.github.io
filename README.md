# Week 10

‚úèÔ∏è Our specifications aim to translate our understanding of the amphibious robot‚Äôs operational needs into precise, quantifiable targets. They represent the intersection between the robot‚Äôs design constraints and the optimal performance characteristics, derived from thorough market research, stakeholder interviews, and technical feasibility studies. The specifications are structured to guide the design process, ensuring that every component contributes to a cohesive and efficient solution.

‚è´The table above presents a condensed view of the meticulous planning behind the Twin-Screw Amphibious Robot. These specifications were derived from a combination of theoretical research, analysis of environmental conditions, and potential user feedback. Navigation accuracy is crucial for the precise mapping and data collection tasks the robot is expected to perform. The battery life has been set to support extensive fieldwork sessions without the need for frequent recharging.

üî¢ **‚Ä¢ Progress Description**

ü•á **‚Ä¢ Milestones Completed**

Conceptual Design: Conduct market research and define user requirements. Develop preliminary design sketches and technical programs. Build a small prototype for validation.
Preliminary modeling completed: We initially built the model and designed the twin-screw wheels to prevent the space between the battery and the circuit board and the connecting parts between them.
Market Research: Through market research, we found that there are many kinds of amphibious robots, but the share of spiral transmission is relatively small.
Battery Energy Management System: The soc of the battery was measured by discharge test, and a method for estimating the state of charge of the lithium-ion battery was designed for different ambient temperatures. That is, Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) algorithm based on Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD).

ü•à **‚Ä¢ Milestones Remaining**

a)Mechanical design: Based on the conceptual design, determine the joints and drive modes. Refine the exterior and interior structural design of the robot.Conduct simulation tests using finite element analysis software to verify the stability and 	durability of the design.

b)Electronic Design: Select appropriate controllers, sensors and actuators. Design the main control board and integrate all sensors and actuators. Test electronic systems for stability and compatibility.

c)Software Development: Select or customize operating systems and development frameworks. Develop control algorithms, path planning, and visual recognition systems for the robot. Design user-friendly interfaces and establish communication protocols with hardware. Perform unit testing and fix possible software bugs.

d)Integration & Testing: Integrate mechanical, electronic, and software systems into a complete robot. Test in real-world environments, such as swamps, wetlands, etc. Debug the performance of the robot to ensure that the design requirements are met.

e)Subsequent Optimization: Make system adjustments and optimizations based on test results. Add more features or improve existing features.

ü•â **‚Ä¢ Problems Encountered or Anticipated**

‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Understaffing and collaboration issues:**
Lack of staff can cause projects to progress slowly and critical issues to not be properly addressed. One way to address this is to consider reassigning tasks to ensure that team members with sufficient expertise and skills are involved in solving key problems. In addition, establishing clear communication and cooperation mechanisms to facilitate information sharing and collaboration among team members can help solve collaboration problems.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Lack of data support:**
Lack of adequate data support may hinder project progress and design effectiveness. You can take the following steps to fix this problem:
Conduct detailed literature research to obtain the latest data and information in related fields.
Consider working with experts, peers or other institutions to obtain the necessary data and information.
Allocate resources in the project's budget to collect and analyze the required data.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Insufficient analysis of basic disciplines:**
Lack of basic disciplinary analysis can lead to serious problems in design. In this case, you can consider the following measures to solve the problem:
Make sure you have sufficient expertise on the project team, especially in areas involving material stress, water resistance, and balance issues.
Conduct detailed research and analysis to understand relevant fundamental discipline principles and apply them to design.
Consult with expert advice to ensure that the fundamental disciplinary issues of the project are properly addressed.

‚è¨ For schedule of the project, the current project schedule for the Fall/Winter 2022 portion of the Twin-Screw Amphibious Robot project is broadly on track. We are slightly ahead on some tasks, such as literature review, while we've encountered a minor delay in the overall planning phase. We have made up for any lost time by adjusting subsequent tasks. Technical challenges and potential supply chain issues have been anticipated, and contingencies are in place. We've compared our progress with the previous Gantt chart, and although there have been slight shifts in deadlines, these are within our planned buffer and do not jeopardize the overall timeline. Our team is focused on adhering to the updated schedule to ensure project completion as anticipated.
